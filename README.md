# Bookshelf-Analysis

This is a short mini project to determine just how well-read my math professors are! In particular, we will be looking at Professor Waddell's bookshelves and use a random cluster-sampling method to estimate how many total pages are believed to be on the bookshelves.

Analysis was conducted using Excel for data gathering and cleaning, and R Programming for statistical analysis.
